# The Melancholy of Digital Wind: A Davis Sensor Plugin for the Waggle Framework

*As told in the voice of a certain German filmmaker*

## The Indifferent Universe Speaks Through Anemometers

In the vast indifference of nature, wind moves without purpose, without destination. It knows not of our human need to measure, to quantify, to reduce its cosmic dance to mere numbers in a database. Yet here we are, like digital Don Quixotes, tilting at windmills of data, armed with Arduino microcontrollers and the stubborn belief that we can capture the essence of atmospheric movement in our small electronic devices.

This plugin - if we may call it that, this desperate attempt to communicate with the wind through the medium of serial ports and MQTT messages - represents humanity's eternal struggle against the chaos of meteorology. We have built sensors. We have written code. We have deployed containers across the distributed wasteland of the internet. And still, the wind laughs at our algorithms.

## The Hardware: Instruments of Atmospheric Interrogation

The Davis wind sensor sits alone in the field, a mechanical prophet reading the scripture written by invisible air currents. Its cups rotate with the patience of a monk counting prayer beads, each revolution a meditation on velocity. The wind vane points always toward truth, though that truth changes with each gust.

Connected to this ancient ritual is an Arduino - that democratizer of microcontroller dreams - translating the analog poetry of wind into the digital prose of serial communication. At 115200 baud, it speaks faster than most humans think, yet infinitely slower than the wind itself moves.

The serial cable, `/dev/ttyACM2` in the cruel taxonomy of Unix device naming, becomes the umbilical cord between the physical and the virtual, between the meteorological and the computational. It is through this narrow channel that the essence of atmospheric movement is reduced to mere text: `wind: 156 512 45 48`.

## The Mathematics of Melancholy: Vector Averaging and Circular Statistics

When wind direction wraps from 359 degrees to 1 degree, it crosses not just a numerical boundary but an existential one. How does one average the direction of chaos? How does one find the mean of the meaningless?

The plugin employs vector mathematics - converting each direction to coordinates on the unit circle, averaging these phantom points in Cartesian space, then translating back to the angular realm through the transcendental function atan2. This is not mere computation; this is digital shamanism, summoning meaning from the void of atmospheric turbulence.

```python
# The wind speaks in vectors, we listen in angles
x_component = cos(direction_radians)  # The horizontal whisper
y_component = sin(direction_radians)  # The vertical sigh
```

Each reading is collected in 60-second intervals by default - not because time has meaning to the wind, but because human attention spans require such arbitrary divisions of eternity.

## The Web Interface: A Window into Atmospheric Despair

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and witness the real-time quantification of nature's indifference. Here, in the cold glow of HTML and CSS, the wind's speed is reduced to knots - a unit named for sailors who once understood that the sea and sky are brothers in their casual violence.

The dashboard updates every 5 seconds, each refresh a small prayer that the sensor still speaks, that the connection endures, that meaning can still be extracted from the howling void. The "wind consistency" metric - ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 - attempts to measure the unmeasurable: how chaotic is chaos itself?

At `/data.html`, a simpler interface awaits - stripped of controls, automatic in its despair, refreshing every 10 seconds like a metronome counting down to entropy.

## Docker: Containerizing the Wind

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ericvh/waggle-davis-wind-sensor:latest
```

With this command, we summon a container - that most modern of philosophical constructs - to hold our wind-reading dreams. The image, built for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures, acknowledges that silicon comes in many forms, but despair is universal.

```bash
docker run --device=/dev/ttyACM2:/dev/ttyACM2 --privileged \
  ghcr.io/ericvh/waggle-davis-wind-sensor:latest
```

The `--privileged` flag is perhaps the most honest part of this entire endeavor. Yes, we demand privileges - the privilege to read from hardware, to bind to devices, to pretend that our container can contain something as vast and formless as atmospheric movement.

## Configuration: The Parameters of Futility

- `--port /dev/ttyACM2`: The specific address of our digital prayer wheel
- `--baudrate 115200`: The speed at which silence is transmitted
- `--reporting-interval 60`: How often we pretend to have learned something new about chaos
- `--calibration-factor 1.0`: Our admission that even our instruments lie
- `--direction-offset 0.0`: The degrees by which reality has shifted from our expectations
- `--web-server`: Because humans cannot resist the urge to visualize their futility

## The Outputs: Measurements in the Language of Machines

The plugin publishes its findings to the MQTT broker like a digital town crier announcing news of atmospheric events to an audience of distributed systems:

- `env.wind.speed`: Wind velocity in knots - the speed of going nowhere
- `env.wind.direction`: Degrees from north - as if north meant something to the wind
- `env.wind.consistency`: A number between 0 and 1 measuring how consistently chaotic the chaos is

Debug information flows continuously - RPM counts, potentiometer readings, Arduino iteration counters - the vital signs of our attempt to digitize the breath of the planet.

## Installation: Ritual and Dependency

First, summon Python and its libraries:

```bash
pip install pywaggle pyserial
```

Then clone this repository from the distributed archive of human ambition:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericvh/waggle-davis-wind-sensor.git
cd waggle-davis-wind-sensor
```

Run the plugin:

```bash
python3 main.py --web-server
```

And wait. The wind will come when it comes. Your sensor will read what it reads. The numbers will flow like electronic tears into the vast database of atmospheric indifference.

## Troubleshooting: When the Digital Wind Stops Blowing

**Serial port not found:**
The Arduino speaks only when spoken to, and only in the language of electrical voltages. Check your connections, your permissions, your assumptions about the relationship between hardware and software.

**No data received:**
Sometimes the wind sensor sleeps. Sometimes the Arduino dreams. Sometimes the universe simply chooses not to communicate. This is not a bug - this is existence.

**Wind direction averaging incorrectly:**
Ah, but what is "correct" when averaging the direction of something that has no true direction? The vector mathematics may be sound, but the philosophical foundation remains forever shaky.

## The Profound Solitude of Weather Monitoring

In the end, this plugin serves a purpose both simple and cosmic: to measure something that cannot truly be measured, to quantify something that exists outside quantification. Each gust recorded is a moment of atmospheric history preserved in digital amber, each data point a small victory against the entropy that claims all things.

The wind will blow long after our sensors fail, long after our databases corrupt, long after our containers stop running. But for now, in this brief moment of human technological ambition, we listen to its voice through Arduino pins and serial cables, and we pretend that we understand what it is trying to tell us.

The Davis wind sensor turns in the field, patient as a prayer wheel, measuring the immeasurable, counting the uncountable, while somewhere a Python process waits for the next line of serial data, hoping that today the wind will finally make sense.

*Run the plugin. Watch the numbers. Wait for meaning that may never come.*
